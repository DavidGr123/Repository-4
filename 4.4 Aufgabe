## Exercise 4: Single Index-Model

#Now we are going to estimate the Portfolio Input Parameters with the Single-Index Model. Use your ten assets and additionally choose the S&P500 as index (same returns etc).

a) Regress all stocks on the index. Show alpha, beta and residual variance. Calculate systematic and firm-specific risk. Are there any significant alphas? (You should double check with the appropriate `PerformanceAnalytics` Functions)

plot(GOOG$date, SP500$adjusted,GOOG$adjusted, type = "line")

ggplot(aes(x=AAPL$adjusted) + GOOG$adjusted

       
       

AAPL <- AAPL[-1]
SP500 <- SP500[-1]
is.Date(SP500$date,AAPL$date)
is.Date(SP500$date)

is.Date(AAPL$date)



# Alpha

CAPM.alpha(SP500,AAPL,)


# b) Extract the betas and calculate systematic and unsystematic risk, derive the whole covariance matrix. To do this you can use _CH15_Factor_Modfels_for_Asset_Returns.pdf (15.3.1)_ and the code
# implemented in the function sharpeFactorEstimator that you find [here](http://financewithr.blogspot.com/2013/06/portfolio-optimization-using-single.html) (please do not just copy everything, but try to understand what you are doing, e.g. check why and if G.hat has the same values as found by the multivariate regression).

# c) Now use the _custom-moments_ functions from Exercise 2 to implement the single-factor model into the portfolio optimization framework and plot the efficient frontier using the parameters estimated by the single factor model next to the EF of the full-covariance model. Calculate MVP, TP etc. and work out the differences in weights, portfolio return and portfolio risk.
